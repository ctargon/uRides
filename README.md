# Git Hub Basic Commands

git pull - every time I start. Updates git hub on my computer

git add . - add all changed files to local repository 

git status - see the changes in green that you are ready to commit

git commit - write subject and more detailed description of what I changed

in vim -type ’s’ to edit and enter the subject/description, then ‘escape’ then colon ‘w’ to write and colon ‘q’ to quit

git push origin master - puts all my data to the cloud

git log - check the most recent commits to the master 

**********IMPORTANT RESET COMMAND**********

git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

-> The above command will reset your local directory with everything that is currently on the master directory if you have
   any merging conflicts like I was having.
